OfficeEquipment Lab - Dymock Brett

The main method can be adjusted by commenting / uncommenting the appropriate Office constructor.  
 ** The constructor with a filename will run the program from a testfile.
 ** The constructor with no parameters will run the program using user input from the system.

This model is primarily tested using the first option above, along with adjustments to the testing file: OfficeTest.txt (found in the main directory).

Exception errors do not stop the program, but are displayed in the terminal alongside other output.

There is one unit test that demonstrates the ListenerException class operating if a machine's status is changed without a Listener installed.

The Class Diagram is not yet complete, a rough work-in-progress has been submitted.
